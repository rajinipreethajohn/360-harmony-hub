        About 360 Harmony Hub
      </h2>

      <p className="text-center text-gray-700 italic mb-8">
        A mindful digital space where science meets soul — and modern wisdom
        meets ancient truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>360 Harmony Hub</b> was born from the belief that balance is not a
        destination but a daily practice. It is a sanctuary for the curious
        modern soul — merging <b>data, design, and dharma</b> into one living
        ecosystem of wisdom and creativity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through our flagship publication,{" "}
        <b>The Yin Yang Newsletter</b>, we explore the sacred interplay between{" "}
        <b>Yin (Feminine)</b> — intuition, rest, receptivity — and{" "}
        <b>Yang (Masculine)</b> — action, focus, purpose. Each week, we flow
        through celestial insights, holistic wellness, mindful finances,
        meditation focus, and sacred affirmations that nurture harmony in daily
        life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you seek calm amidst chaos, or structure within flow, 360
        Harmony Hub offers reflections and rituals to bring you closer to your
        centered self — the space where <b>strength softens into grace</b>.
